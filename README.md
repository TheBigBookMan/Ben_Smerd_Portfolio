# Ben_Smerd_Portfolio

## Introduction
Within this repository is my portfolio that showcases my information, resume, portfolio of applications and contact information for employers to view for my job application. I also include comments about future details I will change as I learn more technical skills.

## Contents
The structure of my portfolio will have semantic elements that represent the header (which contains the introduction and navigation classes). The next semantic element is the main (which contains sections split into specific categories of id elements, they are: home page, about me, resume and portfolio). The id elements then have sub-categories which are defined by classes, they are: home page section (this is incomplete as I don't have the necessary skills at the moment to complete it), about me section (title and hobbies), resume section (title, education, work-experience and skills), portfolio section (title, portfolio applications and services). The last semantic element section is the footer which contains a contact me page id element.

Below will be further information on each section.

## Sections of the Portfolio
### Header
I decided to create the header as a fixed element on the side of the webpage, and when reducing the screen size it is then moved to on top of the screen. I split the header into 3 smaller parts with information.

#### Introduction
This contains an image of myself a long with my full name for an introduction.

#### Navigation
The navigation has the list of sections that are within the portfolio and with the use of the anchor element clicking on the section title will take you to that destination. (I will add in icons to replace the section titles on smaller screen, but not sure how to yet).

#### Personal Links
Beneath the navigation is 3 icons that represent Github, Linkedin and Facebook, and clicking on these will take you to a new tab of my account for those websites. (Will add in more later if I find necessary).

### Main
#### Home Page
This was left out currently as I was thinking of adding in a background picture and then use Javascript (which I haven't learnt yet) to add in a sort of animation.

#### About Me
##### Title
I am going to add another photo of me in this section. I also have some basic information about myself.
##### Hobbies
Within the hobbies I use unordered lists about certain categories of hobbies I have and then use unordered lists inside to list activities I do under those categories.

#### Resume
##### Title
I briefly discuss my previous experience with studies as well as why I have an interest in software engineering and web development.
##### Education
I use an unordered list to discuss the courses I have undertaken/currently undertaking and then within those lists I have unordered lists that list specific classes/skills I learnt from those courses.
##### Work-Experience
I use unordered list to list what jobs I have had previously and then within those lists I have another unordered list which explains the certain tasks I was doing at the jobs.
##### Skills
I use an unordered list to list of areas of skills and then explain why I am good at them. Using a span element to highlight the specific skill.

#### Portfolio
##### Title
I don't have any information about applications in here yet because I haven't created any projects, but once I do and I properly link them in then I will have more descriptions about what the applications do. Currently the pictures have anchors but they don't lead anywhere. With the use of semantic elements of figure and figcaption I created placeholders, when I get applications I have made the picture and caption will be relevant.
##### Application 1
(Nothing to link in yet).
##### Application 2
(Nothing to link in yet).
##### Application 3
(Nothing to link in yet).
##### Application 4
(Nothing to link in yet).
##### Portfolio Services
Using an unordered list I briefly discuss what sort of services I will be able to provide to employers who are looking. This will be increased over time as I learn more skills.

### Footer
#### Contact Me
A section for details about how employers can contact me.
##### Contact Details
Using an unordered list I have my location, email and phone number present.
##### Contact Me Form
Using the form for labels and inputs (text and textarea), I have created a section where an employer can write in their name, email, subject matter and message to send to me. Once I learn how the backend part works then I will update it.
